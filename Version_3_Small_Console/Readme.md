This is the function which can run on windows system to change the DMX HDMI Player's Firmware.


# [Version 3_Small_Console](./Version_3/)

This firmware is intended for small, manual-fader DMX-512 consoles. Since the faders on these compact consoles have coarse step sizes and can’t reliably adjust in single-DMX increments, we partition the 0–255 range for both Folder and File into 10 segments. As a result, Channel 2 selects from 10 Folders and Channel 3 selects from 10 Files, making the Video Player easy to operate with small DMX-512 consoles.
